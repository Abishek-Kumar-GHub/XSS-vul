The script will be stored and executed when the page is loaded, resulting in an alert pop-up. This is the essence of Stored XSS.

Features:
Comment Section: Allows users to post comments including their name, email, website, and a comment message.
Vulnerable to XSS: The comments are rendered without proper sanitization, making them vulnerable to storing and executing malicious scripts.
Running the Application
Follow these steps to run the application locally:

Prerequisites:
Python 3 and pip installed on your system.
Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/xss-lab.git
cd xss-lab
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The application should be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Access the application: Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can now view the blog, post comments, and see the vulnerability in action.

How to Demonstrate the Vulnerability:
Go to the "Post a Comment" page by clicking on Post a Comment link.
Enter a name, email, and a comment like this:
html
Copy code
<script>alert(1)</script>
Click Post Comment.
Go back to the blog page, and you will see the alert pop-up demonstrating the stored XSS vulnerability.
Fixing the Vulnerability (Solution)
The vulnerability can be fixed by properly sanitizing user input or by escaping HTML content before rendering. This prevents malicious scripts from being executed. A potential solution would involve modifying the code to escape user inputs or using a library to sanitize HTML.

Example of Fix:
In the blog.html file, you can modify how comments are rendered:

html
Copy code
<p>{{ comment.comment | safe }}</p>  <!-- This is vulnerable -->
Change to:

html
Copy code
<p>{{ comment.comment }}</p>  <!-- Proper sanitization required -->
Alternatively, you can use libraries like bleach to sanitize input before storing or rendering.

### Notes:
- Replace the `your-username` in the clone URL with your actual GitHub username when you use it in your repository.
- Make sure you add the appropriate `requirements.txt` file with the necessary dependencies (e.g., Flask, bleach, etc.).
